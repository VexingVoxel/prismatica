# Incremental Player Type – Tinkerer-Builder v0.3

## 1. Overview

The **Tinkerer-Builder** is an "Experience Group" player who views the game as a **machine or toy to be constructed**.
They are the "Inventors." Unlike the Planner (who wants the *best* build), the Tinkerer wants *their own* build. They love modular systems, layouts, and "what if?" experiments.

They are most at home in games that support **customization**, **modular synergies**, and **creative expression**.

## 2. Axes Position (v0.3 Coordinates)

* **A1 Engagement:** **Active (Tinker)** (Constantly tweaking, rearranging, respecing).
* **A2 Horizon:** **Meso** (Focused on the current "Run" or "Layout").
* **A3 Cog. Load:** **Crunch (Medium)** (Wants systemic depth, but focuses on interactions/logic vs. raw math).
* **A4 Variance:** **Volatility (Experimentation)** (Willing to break the build to try a crazy idea).
* **A5 Abstraction:** **World** (Concrete systems: Cards, Conveyors, Runes, Grid Layouts).
* **A6 Structure:** **Open (Sandbox)** (Needs tools and freedom, not just a linear path).

---

## 3. Core Motivation (The “Why”)

* **Expression:** "I built this." (Ownership of the strategy).
* **Curiosity (Systemic):** "Does the Fire Rune trigger the Oil Rune?"
* **Aesthetics (v0.3 Update):** Organizing a base/grid so it looks neat or symmetrical.
* **Novelty:** Trying "weird" builds that aren't meta, just to see if they work.

## 4. Typical Behavior Signatures (The “What They Do”)

* **Constant Respec:** Uses the "Reset Skills" button more than any other type.
* **Grid Obsession:** If there is a spatial component (inventory tetris, factory layout), they spend hours optimizing it.
* **Ignoring the Guide:** Deliberately avoids "Meta Builds" because copying is boring.
* **Sub-Optimal Play:** Will run a "Crit Build" even if "Damage Build" is mathematically better, because they like seeing crits.
* **Session Pattern:**
    * **Tinker Session:** 30 minutes of changing cards/gear.
    * **Test Run:** 10 minutes of watching it run.

---

## 5. Common Trait Overlays

* **Explorer:** Finds hidden interactions.
* **Planner:** Sometimes overlaps, but Tinkerer is less rigid about "Perfect ROI."
* **Surger:** Builds "Rube Goldberg machines" to create massive surge spikes.

---

## 6. Modes / States

* **Lab Mode:** In the menu/inventory, reading card text and combining items.
* **Sandbox Mode:** Testing a hypothesis.
* **Rebuild Mode:** Tearing everything down because "it's messy."

---

## 7. Design Hooks (How to Satisfy Them)

* **Free/Cheap Respecs:** Essential. If experimentation costs currency, they stop playing.
* **Modular Systems:** Cards, Gems, Runes, Gear with unique effects (not just +Stats).
* **Spatial Mechanics:** Adjacency bonuses ("Buildings next to Water get +5%").
* **Loadouts:** Ability to save "Build A" and "Build B."
* **Synergy Discovery:** Unexpected interactions between rare items.

---

## 8. Design Anti-Patterns (How to Churn Them)

* **Permanent Choices:** "Choose Class A or B. You can never switch." (Nightmare).
* **Linear Upgrades:** Just a single line of buttons "Level 1 -> Level 2." (Nothing to tinker with).
* **Solved Meta:** If one build is 1000x better than everything else, experimentation feels foolish.
* **High Friction UI:** Hard to move items, no "Unequip All" button.

## 9. Reward / Fun Snapshot

* **Tempo:** **Meso** (The reward is the successful experiment).
* **Intensity:** **Medium** (Satisfaction of "It works!").
* **Fun Mix:** **Creativity/Expression** + **Discovery (Systemic)**.
