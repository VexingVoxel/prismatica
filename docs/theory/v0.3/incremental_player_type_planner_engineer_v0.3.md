# Incremental Player Type – Planner-Engineer v0.3

## 1. Overview

The **Planner-Engineer** is a "Logic Group" player who views the game as a **complex optimization puzzle**.
They are motivated by designing, configuring, and refining an efficient engine that performs well over long periods. They are the "Architects" of the incremental genre.

They are most at home in games that reward **foresight**, **systemic understanding**, and **careful meta-planning**.

## 2. Axes Position (v0.3 Coordinates)

* **A1 Engagement:** **Idle / Mixed** (Sets up the system, then observes).
* **A2 Horizon:** **Meta** (Thinks in days, weeks, and prestige cycles).
* **A3 Cog. Load:** **Crunch (High)** (Enjoys math, formulas, and complex interactions).
* **A4 Variance:** **Reliability** (Seeks predictable returns; hates uncontrolled RNG).
* **A5 Abstraction:** **Interface** (Sees the game as a dashboard/spreadsheet).
* **A6 Structure:** **Open** (Wants tools to build *their own* efficiency engine).

---

## 3. Core Motivation (The “Why”)

* **Mastery via Understanding:** Wants to "solve" the game's math.
* **Efficiency:** Derives deep satisfaction from squeezing 1% more output through better routing or allocation.
* **Predictability:** Wants to know that if they invest X, they will reliably get Y.
* **Agency:** Treats the game like a simulation to be tuned, not a ride to be taken.

## 4. Typical Behavior Signatures (The “What They Do”)

* **The "Spreadsheet Check":** Will pause the game to calculate (mentally or externally) which upgrade offers the best ROI.
* **Prestige Discipline:** Delays prestige until a specific, calculated breakpoint is reached.
* **Automation Tuning:** Spends most of their "Active" time configuring automation logic (priorities, scripts) rather than clicking.
* **Wiki/Community Use:** Often reads the wiki *before* playing to understand the scaling formulas.
* **Session Pattern:**
    * **High-Intensity Setup:** 10–20 minutes of reallocating points and setting routes.
    * **Low-Intensity Monitor:** Checks in once a day to verify the curve matches the prediction.

---

## 5. Common Trait Overlays

* **Competitor:** Compares "Time to Endgame" or "Efficiency Score" with others.
* **Collector:** Wants to fill the entire Tech Tree, even the suboptimal nodes.
* **Explorer:** Looks for "Synergies" (hidden multiplicative interactions) rather than just map locations.

---

## 6. Modes / States

* **Analysis Mode:** Reading tooltips, comparing stats, doing the math.
* **Refactor Mode:** Tearing down a build because they found a more efficient path.
* **Validation Mode:** Watching the numbers tick up to confirm the build is working as intended.

---

## 7. Design Hooks (How to Satisfy Them)

* **Transparent Math:** Show the formulas. "Yield = (Base * Multiplier) ^ exponent."
* **Configurable Automation:** Don't just auto-buy; let them set *rules* (e.g., "Buy X only if Y > 100").
* **Wide Meta-Trees:** Give them distinct paths (e.g., "Idle Build" vs. "Active Build") so there is a choice to be made.
* **Statistics & Graphs:** In-game tools that show production history or estimated time to goal.
* **Respec Friendly:** Allow them to fix "mistakes" easily so they can iterate on their plan.

---

## 8. Design Anti-Patterns (How to Churn Them)

* **Opaque/Hidden Scaling:** "Upgrade increases production by 'a bit'." (This creates anxiety).
* **Forced RNG:** "1% chance to lose progress" or "Randomly deletes a building." (Violates their need for Reliability).
* **Fake Choices:** A skill tree where one path is mathematically superior in all cases.
* **Trivial Complexity:** Systems that look complex but solve themselves (e.g., linear auto-buyers).

## 9. Reward / Fun Snapshot

* **Tempo:** **Meso–Macro** (The plan pays off over days).
* **Intensity:** **Medium** (Satisfying "click" of pieces fitting together).
* **Fun Mix:** **Mastery Fun (Systemic)** + **Problem Solving**.
