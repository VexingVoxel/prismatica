# Incremental Player Type – Gardener v0.3

## 1. Overview

The **Gardener** is an "Experience Group" player who views the game as a **living space to be cultivated**.
They are motivated by **beauty, growth, and reliability**. They do not play to "beat" the game or "solve" a puzzle; they play to nurture a digital environment that flourishes over time.

They are most at home in games that feel **cozy**, **forgiving**, and **visually expressive**.

## 2. Axes Position (v0.3 Coordinates)

* **A1 Engagement:** **Idle** (Prefers minimal active input; wants the game to grow itself).
* **A2 Horizon:** **Meta** (Thinks in days, months, and "forever").
* **A3 Cog. Load:** **Flow (Low)** (Wants relaxation and low-friction decisions).
* **A4 Variance:** **Reliability** (Strongly averse to risk, decay, or negative RNG).
* **A5 Abstraction:** **World** (Engages with the visuals: trees, buildings, cities).
* **A6 Structure:** **Open (Cultivator)** (Wants to tend their patch, not necessarily race to a finish line).

## 3. Core Motivation (The “Why”)

* **Nurturing:** Enjoys the feeling of taking care of something.
* **Aesthetic Growth:** Wants to *see* the progress (e.g., a village getting bigger), not just see a number go up.
* **Routine:** Uses the game as a comforting daily ritual (morning coffee check-in).
* **Safety:** Wants a low-stress environment where mistakes don't ruin progress.

## 4. Typical Behavior Signatures (The “What They Do”)

* **The "Check-In" Loop:** Log in, collect resources, buy the prettiest/next upgrade, log out.
* **Hoarding:** Often sits on resources rather than spending them optimally, "saving up" for a specific visual unlock.
* **Ignoring the Meta:** May ignore complex prestige layers if they reset the visual progress ("I don't want to burn my forest!").
* **Decoration:** Will spend premium currency on skins or themes rather than power.
* **Session Pattern:**
    * **Consistent Micro-Sessions:** 2–5 minutes, 2–3 times a day.
    * **Long Retention:** If treated well, they stay for years.

## 5. Common Trait Overlays

* **Collector:** Wants to unlock every fish, dragon, or building type.
* **Narrativist:** Enjoys reading the flavor text of the items they grow.
* **Cozy:** Specifically seeks "wholesome" vibes (avoiding grimdark themes).

---

## 6. Modes / States

* **Maintenance Mode:** The daily harvest ritual.
* **Decoration Mode:** Rearranging the layout for looks, not efficiency.
* **Observation Mode:** Just watching the little people/numbers move for a minute before closing the app.

## 7. Design Hooks (How to Satisfy Them)

* **100% Offline Progress:** Never punish them for sleeping. "Welcome back! Your garden grew while you were away."
* **Visual Evolution:** Level 1 House looks different from Level 10 House.
* **Permanent Unlocks:** Things that persist through prestige (collections, achievements, pets).
* **Simple Choices:** "Do you want to upgrade the Farm or the Mine?" (Avoid complex skill trees).
* **Peaceful Themes:** Music and art that reduce anxiety.

---

## 8. Design Anti-Patterns (How to Churn Them)

* **Decay/Withering:** "If you don't log in for 24 hours, your crops die." (Instant quit).
* **Full Hard Resets:** Wiping the visual progress completely feels like destroying their work.
* **Forced Active Click-Spam:** "Click 500 times to unlock automation." (It feels like chores).
* **Hostile RNG:** "1% chance your building burns down."
* **Aggressive Timers:** Limited-time events that trigger FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) anxiety.

## 9. Reward / Fun Snapshot

* **Tempo:** **Macro** (Growth happens over weeks).
* **Intensity:** **Low** (Cozy, warm satisfaction).
* **Fun Mix:** **Comfort Fun** + **Expression (Aesthetic)**.
