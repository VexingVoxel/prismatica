# Incremental Player Type – Challenger v0.3

## 1. Overview

The **Challenger** is a "Logic Group" player who is motivated by **proof of skill**.
They are the "Athletes" of the genre. Unlike the Planner (who wants to solve the puzzle), the Challenger wants to **beat the test**. They value execution, difficult constraints, and recognition.

They are most at home in games that offer **hard modes**, **leaderboards**, and **clear fail states**.

## 2. Axes Position (v0.3 Coordinates)

* **A1 Engagement:** **Active** (High focus interaction during attempts).
* **A2 Horizon:** **Session / Run** (Focused on the current attempt).
* **A3 Cog. Load:** **Crunch (High)** (Needs to understand mechanics to exploit them).
* **A4 Variance:** **Volatility (Skill)** (Wants the risk of failure to make success meaningful).
* **A5 Abstraction:** **Interface** (Views the game as a set of rules/constraints).
* **A6 Structure:** **Directed** (Wants explicit goals: "Beat Boss X in Y seconds").

---

## 3. Core Motivation (The “Why”)

* **Overcoming Resistance:** Enjoys the friction of a difficult goal.
* **Validation:** "I did something not everyone can do."
* **Fairness:** Wants the difficulty to come from *mechanics*, not random bad luck.
* **Competition:** Even if playing solo, they compete against the dev's design or their own previous records.

## 4. Typical Behavior Signatures (The “What They Do”)

* **Constraint Seeking:** Turns on "Hard Mode," "Ironman Mode," or "No Prestige Challenges" immediately.
* **Min-Maxing for Specifics:** Builds purely to beat *one* obstacle (e.g., "Boss Build"), then respecs immediately.
* **Guide Usage:** Will look up "Meta Builds" not to copy them blindly, but to understand the ceiling of what is possible.
* **Session Pattern:**
    * **Practice/Fail Loop:** Repeated short attempts where they fail, adjust, and retry.
    * **Victory Lap:** A brief period of easy play after cracking a wall, before seeking the next wall.

---

## 5. Common Trait Overlays

* **Competitor:** The most common overlay. Obsessed with rank.
* **Surger:** Enjoys challenges that require high-speed clicking/timing.
* **Planner:** Enjoys challenges that require complex theory-crafting (e.g., "Beat the game with only 1 building type").

---

## 6. Modes / States

* **Attempt Mode:** Hyper-focused, 100% active attention.
* **Theory Mode:** Analyzing why the last attempt failed.
* **Grind Mode:** Reluctant farming only to get the stats needed for the next attempt.

---

## 7. Design Hooks (How to Satisfy Them)

* **Explicit Challenges:** "Level 100 with no upgrades." "Speedrun to 1 Billion."
* **Meaningful Achievements:** Badges that prove skill, not just time played.
* **Leaderboards:** Global or local (Personal Best).
* **Skill-Based Mechanics:** Active skills that reward perfect timing (e.g., parries, critical reload windows).
* **Scaling Difficulty:** The game *must* push back. Infinite easy growth is boring.

---

## 8. Design Anti-Patterns (How to Churn Them)

* **Pay-to-Win:** If money buys the victory, the achievement is worthless.
* **Unavoidable RNG Failure:** "The boss randomly one-shots you." (Violates Fairness).
* **Time-Gating Skill:** "You cannot beat this boss until you wait 3 weeks for passive income."
* **Flat Difficulty:** If the game plays itself, the Challenger leaves.

## 9. Reward / Fun Snapshot

* **Tempo:** **Meso** (The attempt takes minutes/hours).
* **Intensity:** **High** (Adrenaline spike upon success).
* **Fun Mix:** **Challenge Fun** + **Mastery Fun (Execution)**.
