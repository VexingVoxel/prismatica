# Incremental Player Type – Surger v0.3

## 1. Overview

The **Surger** is a "Logic Group" player (focused on the Interface) who lives for **Action and Flow**.
They are the "Action Heroes." They don't want to build a slow engine (Planner) or suffer through a hard test (Challenger); they want to **feel powerful right now**. They chase "juice," spikes, and visceral feedback.

They are most at home in games that provide **frenzy windows**, **combos**, and **tactile satisfaction**.

## 2. Axes Position (v0.3 Coordinates)

* **A1 Engagement:** **Active** (Constant input: clicking, tapping, skill spamming).
* **A2 Horizon:** **Session** (Short-term feedback: "What happens in the next 10 seconds?").
* **A3 Cog. Load:** **Flow (Medium)** (Wants to react and rhythm, not calculate).
* **A4 Variance:** **Volatility (Juice)** (Loves massive spikes, Crits, and exponential procs).
* **A5 Abstraction:** **Interface (Visceral)** (The UI is a toy to be poked).
* **A6 Structure:** **Directed (Reactor)** (Responds to glowing buttons and prompts).

---

## 3. Core Motivation (The “Why”)

* **The Spike:** Wants to see the numbers go from 100 to 1,000,000 in a single second.
* **Tactile Feedback:** Enjoys the physical act of tapping/clicking/swiping.
* **Rhythm:** Likes the flow state of managing cooldowns and procs.
* **Spectacle:** Wants big floating text, screen shake, and flashy effects.

## 4. Typical Behavior Signatures (The “What They Do”)

* **The "Golden Cookie" Chaser:** Will sit idle and stare at the screen waiting for the "Frenzy" prompt, then erupt into activity.
* **Cooldown Stacking:** Saves all big cooldowns to pop them exactly at the same time for a massive multiplier.
* **Early Prestige:** Often prestiges *too early* just to feel the fast ramp-up speed again.
* **Session Pattern:**
    * **Burst Sessions:** 2–5 minutes of frantic activity.
    * **Churn Risk:** If the game forces a 1-hour wait with nothing to do, they quit.

---

## 5. Common Trait Overlays

* **Competitor:** Races against friends for "Highest Damage Single Hit."
* **Collector:** Collects "Shinies" or visual upgrades that make the surge look cooler.

---

## 6. Modes / States

* **Frenzy Mode:** The high-dopamine state when multipliers align.
* **Setup Mode:** Quickly buying upgrades to prepare for the next frenzy.
* **Boredom Mode:** If cooldowns are long and nothing is happening, they are at high risk of closing the app.

---

## 7. Design Hooks (How to Satisfy Them)

* **Active Skills:** Buttons that do big things immediately.
* **Combo Systems:** "Click 10 times to trigger a 5x boost."
* **Visceral UI:** Numbers that physically grow, screen shake, satisfying audio cues.
* **RNG Procs:** "10% chance to deal 1000% damage." (The anticipation is fun).
* **Short Loops:** Prestige mechanics that allow for quick resets and rapid re-climbing.

---

## 8. Design Anti-Patterns (How to Churn Them)

* **Linear AFK Math:** "Come back in 8 hours to buy one upgrade." (The Surger hates waiting).
* **Zero Active Agency:** An idle game with no clicking or skill buttons.
* **Flat Visuals:** Tiny text logs instead of big popping numbers.
* **Punishing Misclicks:** If missing a beat ruins the run, it kills the Flow state.

## 9. Reward / Fun Snapshot

* **Tempo:** **Micro–Meso** (Seconds to Minutes).
* **Intensity:** **High** (Constant dopamine hits).
* **Fun Mix:** **Spectacle Fun** + **Action Fun** + **Flow**.
