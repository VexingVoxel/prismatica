# Incremental Player Type – Voyager v0.3

## 1. Overview

The **Voyager** is an "Experience Group" player who is motivated by **discovery and novelty**.
They are the "Explorers." They don't care about the perfect build (Planner) or the perfect run (Challenger); they care about **what is behind the locked door**. They play to unfold the content.

They are most at home in games that offer **unfolding mechanics**, **paradigm shifts**, and **narrative layers**.

## 2. Axes Position (v0.3 Coordinates)

* **A1 Engagement:** **Mixed** (Will grind actively to reach an unlock, then idle).
* **A2 Horizon:** **Meta** (Focused on the next milestone/zone).
* **A3 Cog. Load:** **Flow (Medium)** (Wants to learn new things, but not crunch heavy math).
* **A4 Variance:** **Reliability** (Wants steady progress toward the next discovery).
* **A5 Abstraction:** **World** (Focuses on Biomes, Planets, Lore, and New Systems).
* **A6 Structure:** **Directed (Explorer)** (Needs a clear path: "Unlock Mars at Level 50").

## 3. Core Motivation (The “Why”)

* **Curiosity:** "What does that blacked-out upgrade do?"
* **Variety:** Gets bored doing the same thing. Needs the game to change rules (Paradigm Shift).
* **Expansion:** Wants to feel the universe getting bigger.
* **Narrative:** (v0.3 Update) Often driven by story crumbs ("Diaries") or world-building.

## 4. Typical Behavior Signatures (The “What They Do”)

* **The "Unlock" Rush:** Will play obsessively to reach a new zone, explore it for 10 minutes, then slow down.
* **Content Consumption:** Burns through content faster than developers can make it.
* **Inefficient Experimentation:** Will buy the "Mystery Box" upgrade instead of the "Damage +10%" upgrade, just to see what it is.
* **Session Pattern:**
    * **Binge Sessions:** When a new layer unlocks (Paradigm Shift).
    * **Maintenance:** When stuck on a long grind wall between unlocks.

---

## 5. Common Trait Overlays

* **Narrativist:** Reads every log entry.
* **Collector:** Wants to fill the "Bestiary" or "Map."
* **Planner:** (Light overlay) Plans specifically to reach the unlock threshold faster.

---

## 6. Modes / States

* **Push Mode:** Grinding to reach the key.
* **Discovery Mode:** The "Honeymoon phase" of a new mechanic/layer.
* **Plateau Mode:** The danger zone. If the next unlock is too far away, they churn.

---

## 7. Design Hooks (How to Satisfy Them)

* **Unfolding Gameplay:** The game starts as a Clicker, becomes an RPG, then becomes a City Builder. (e.g., *Candy Box*, *Universal Paperclips*).
* **Silhouettes & Teasers:** Show them what they *can't* have yet. "Locked until Area 5."
* **Visual Biome Shifts:** Area 2 should look completely different from Area 1.
* **Lore Logs:** Text that unlocks alongside progress.
* **Hidden Achievements:** Secrets that require lateral thinking/poking around.

---

## 8. Design Anti-Patterns (How to Churn Them)

* **"More of the Same":** Prestige just resets numbers but adds no new mechanics.
* **Static Art:** Background never changes.
* **Invisible Walls:** Progress bars that move slowly with no visual indication of *why* (no milestone in sight).
* **Math-Only Unlocks:** "Unlock 'Variable X' to increase 'Variable Y'." (Boring).

## 9. Reward / Fun Snapshot

* **Tempo:** **Meso–Macro** (Major dopamine hits at unlocks).
* **Intensity:** **Medium** (Wonder and Surprise).
* **Fun Mix:** **Discovery Fun** + **Novelty** + **Narrative**.
