# Economy Design v0.1: The Resonance Network (Core Amplification)

## 1. Core Principle: Active Amplification

This economic model fundamentally shifts the role of placed structures. Instead of directly generating passive income (Sparks/second), structures (Squares) now **amplify the value of manual clicks on the Core**. All currency generation is tied to player action in the early game.

**Motivation:**
*   **Address Rapid Early Progression:** Prevents exponential growth from quickly overshadowing player input.
*   **Sustain Active Engagement:** Ensures the "Click the Core" mechanic remains central and rewarding throughout the early and mid-game.
*   **Clear Feedback Loop:** Placing and upgrading structures immediately makes player actions more potent.
*   **Cater to Surger Archetype:** Provides direct, visceral feedback that their actions are becoming more powerful.

## 2. Mechanics: The Resonance Network

### A. Base Core Click Value
*   The game starts with a base value of Sparks generated per manual click on the Core (e.g., `10 Sparks/Click`).

### B. Structure Contribution (Additive)
*   Each placed structure contributes an additive bonus to the Core's Click Value. This is the "Resonance Network."
*   **Level 1 Square:** Adds a specific amount (e.g., `+10 Sparks/Click`) to the base Core Click Value.
*   **Leveling:** Upgrading a square increases its individual additive contribution. (e.g., a Level 2 square might add `+20 Sparks/Click`).
*   **Total Click Value:** `Base Core Click Value + Sum of all Square Contributions`.

### C. Adjacency Bonus (Applied to Contribution)
*   Existing adjacency bonuses (e.g., `+10% if touching Core`) are now applied to the **individual square's contribution to the Core Click Value**, not to passive production.
    *   This further incentivizes strategic placement.

### D. Absence of Passive Income (Early Phase)
*   In the early stages of the game, there is no automatic Spark generation. All Sparks must be earned through Core clicks.
*   This ensures the player remains actively involved in the economy.

### E. Visual Feedback
*   Clicking the Core still triggers the spark VFX. These sparks now represent the amplified click value.
*   Upgrading a square visually changes it (as per Visual Design v0.3), now directly correlating to a stronger click.

## 3. Future Considerations: Reintroducing Passive Income

*   To cater to the **Gardener** and **Planner** archetypes in later stages, passive income (automation) can be introduced as a significant mid-to-late game unlock.
*   This could take the form of:
    *   A high-level "Automation Hub" building.
    *   A significant Core upgrade that enables an "Auto-Clicker" or "Passive Generator" module.
    *   "Specialized" structures that *only* generate passive income, distinct from amplifiers.
*   The timing of this reintroduction is crucial for balancing active engagement with the desired idle game progression.

## 4. Impact on Player Archetypes

*   **Surger (The Action Hero):** Strongly supported. Their clicks remain central and become increasingly powerful.
*   **Tinkerer-Builder (The Inventor):** Rewarded for efficient placement that maximizes click value.
*   **Planner-Engineer (The Architect):** Challenged to optimize the network for maximum amplification per click.
*   **Gardener (The Cultivator):** While active, they see their cultivated network directly empower their actions. (Later automation unlock is key for this type).
*   **Challenger (The Athlete):** Can set personal bests for click efficiency and resource generation rates.
*   **Voyager (The Explorer):** Their progress through the game's "ages" will be marked by increasingly potent interactions with the Core.
